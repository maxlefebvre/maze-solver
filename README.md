# Maze Solver

Generates a random maze and highlights longest path. Reason for this program is for me to experiment with some search and path-finding algorithms.

## Roadmap

* [X] Setup UI and basic maze generator
* [X] Implement longest path finder (naive approach)
* [ ] Generate maze with start and exit
* [ ] Implement naive approach to find shortest path
* [ ] Implement breadth first search
* [ ] Implement depth first search
* [ ] Implement graph and node class to use for next algorithms
* [ ] Implement Dijkstra's algorithm
* [ ] Implement A* algorithm
